- It's possible to use two approachs of meassuraments, only valid to climatic data (temperature, humidity,light expossure)
	- one point of meassuraments near of ground.
	- two and three meassure points with differents highness, to compensate micro enviroment differences.
	- (OBS) is necessary estimate the area of influence to each micro enviroment.

- Will be necessary a autonomus power supply, a photovoltaic plate is the best choice, because is possible to use the same hardware for two functions. 
	- charge a battery bank, that's provisioned to circuit needs.
	- read data necessary to calculate ligth incidence.
